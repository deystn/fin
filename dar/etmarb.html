                            <p>The royal tailor, Lady Yoon has her eyes on something else – a visible torn hole on the crown prince’s trouser, just above his ankle.</p>
                            <p>“Baekhyun, come here.” Her son rushes to her side, confused.</p>
                            <p>“Yes, mama?”</p>
                            <p>“Look,” she says quietly, pointing towards the crown prince’s ankle. “His Highness might need a little help with that. Do you still remember what I taught you about sewing?” The servant boy nods, excited as he snatches a brown thread and a needle from his mother, then approaches the prince. At the sight of the needle between the servant boy’s fingers, Chanyeol’s eyes widen as he yells for his mother.</p>
                            <p>“It’s all right, Chanyeol,” the queen says, “Let him help you.” Baekhyun smiles as he carefully sews the ripped part of the prince’s trousers.</p>
                            <p>“Perhaps one day you will become the prince’s tailor.” The servant boy beams with pleasure, beyond happy from the king’s thoughtful words.</p>

                            <p>Snatched out of his daydream, Chanyeol jolts at the sound of laughter coming from outside. He slips away from his maids, walking towards his window, buttoning up his shirt as he stares at the pair of boys chasing after each other under the morning sun. He watches as Baekhyun childishly shoves the second prince away when he tries to get closer. Chanyeol gently tugs onto the curtain, a frown present on his face when he sees the king and queen watching the two boys as they have breakfast outside.</p>
                            <p>“Seems like they forgot to invite me for breakfast again,” the crown prince murmurs to himself. “Even the stupid servant tailor is there with them.”</p>
                            <p>Chanyeol gazes at the way Sehun holds onto Baekhyun when he finally catches him, whispering something in his ear that made the tailor let out a bubbly laugh. They return to the table where the king and the queen await them with matching grins, rewarding the two with pats on their shoulders. He watches as Baekhyun takes a seat next to the second prince, clinking teacups playfully while the tailor erupts in a fit of bright laughter once more, the nostalgic sound of it pulling out a cherished memory in Chanyeol’s mind.</p>

                            <p>Baekhyun flinches when he sees a pair of lovers, walking towards him. They giggle against each other, holding one another in their arms. When they pull away, Baekhyun makes his presence known when he coughs softly, embarrassed.</p>
                            <p>“The tower is kind of occupied,” he scratches the back of his head, with his gaze still planted on the floor. “There’s an empty room near the general study room. I won’t tell the king.”</p>
                            <p>“Yes, the tower is occupied.” </p>
                            <p>Baekhyun raises his head to see the crown prince scowling in his way. Chanyeol rolls his eyes. “And I expect you to leave.”</p>
                            <p>Baekhyun’s mouth gapes as he stares at the prince and the familiar girl staring back at him.</p>
                            <p>“I was here first.” He blurts out. “I don’t want to leave, this is my spot.”</p>
                            <p>The blushing girl jabs her elbow to the prince’s side, mumbling. “Chanyeol, the boy is right. Let’s go somewhere else.” </p>

                            <p>By the time Chanyeol arrives at the barn, with his drawing book and pencils in tow, he sees the royal tailor already sitting there on a large picnic mat, surrounded by sunflowers. When Baekhyun finally notices Chanyeol walking towards him, he immediately brightens up with a big smile. Chanyeol can literally feel his heart speeding up again.</p>
                            <p>“Aren’t you scared if the goats will come towards you when they see all this food?” Chanyeol takes a seat beside the man, snatching a slice of watermelon out of his hands.</p>
                            <p>“I’m not scared of them,” Baekhyun shrugs, grabbing another slice of watermelon after Chanyeol stole his previous one. “I’ll gladly feed them.”</p>
                            <p>“That is incredibly unsanitary.” Chanyeol grimaces, wiping the wet bits of before he brings his drawing book on his lap, flipping the pages open.</p>
                            <p>“Oh!” Baekhyun exclaims once he sees the familiar drawing book. “Did you draw something new? Come here, let me see.”</p>
                            <p>He grins with pride when he hears Baekhyun gasping upon seeing the new drawings. “Are they good? Do you like them?”</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>The prince seems lost for a moment, his eyes glazed with wonder as he stares at Baekhyun’s outstretched hand. Baekhyun grasps onto the prince’s hands, bringing them down to his waist before he holds onto the prince’s shoulders again, flashing a nervous smile.</p>
                            <p>“Put your feet on mine, it’ll be easier to lead you.” Baekhyun says.</p>
                            <p>“Have you gone mad? I’d crush you!” Chanyeol frets, tightening his hold on the royal tailor’s waist.</p>
                            <p>Baekhyun yelps at the sudden pressure on his feet, biting his lip as he tries to lead the prince. “Not… that… heavy…. See?”</p>
                            <p>It’s just for a short while, but Baekhyun manages to hear it; the prince’s soft chuckle as he watches Baekhyun struggling to move.</p>
                            <p>The prince is actually capable of smiling at him – that’s a first. Baekhyun knows that Chanyeol will never want to be seen with him, but seeing the prince laughing along with him strikes a glimmer of hope in restoring his old friendship with this sunflower prince.</p>

                            <p>Chanyeol leans into his touch with a gentle sigh. Moments like these are the ones that make Baekhyun realize that underneath the crown prince’s cold demeanor there is the clueless man who knows nothing about handling a kingdom that he will be forced to lead.</p>
                            <p>He chuckles, trying to distract himself before he notices the small cuts on the bridge of the prince’s nose. Baekhyun frowns slightly, “Did you hurt yourself during your training?”</p>
                            <p>“Only a little. It doesn’t hurt.” Chanyeol shakes his head, hiding his face in the crook of Baekhyun’s neck, embracing him too tight. “I missed you so much.”</p>
                            <p>“It hasn’t even been a month. Put me down!” Baekhyun laughs, hitting the prince’s back. “What will you do when I get married soon, hmm?”</p>
                            <p>The crown prince doesn’t reply. He doesn’t say a word, only pulling Baekhyun in closer and closer, breathing him in. Chanyeol keeps shaking his head on and on, refusing to let Baekhyun to look at him in this state.</p>
